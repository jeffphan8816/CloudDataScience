This directory contains the backend code for the system. It contains 3 subdirectories:
* api: holds the public api fission functions
* fission: holds the background data collection fission functions
* data_functions: contains functions for interacting with static data

This is structured as a Python package that is installed with setup.py in the parent directory.
